Changes since Rhino 1.6R4
=========================
- Added org.mozilla.javascript.PolicySecurityController as a concrete 
  implementation of an org.mozilla.javascript.SecurityController and the 
  preferred way of integrating with Java security architecture.
- When no security controller is in use, generated classes and scripts run in
  the ProtectionDomain of Rhino classes.
- Wrapped access to system properties and creation of class loaders into
  AccessController.doPrivileged() to nicely play in secured environments.
