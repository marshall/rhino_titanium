Changes since Rhino 1.6R5
=========================
- Added org.mozilla.javascript.PolicySecurityController as a concrete 
  implementation of an org.mozilla.javascript.SecurityController and the 
  preferred way of integrating with Java security architecture.
- When no security controller is in use, generated classes and scripts run in
  the ProtectionDomain of Rhino classes.
- Wrapped access to system properties and creation of class loaders into
  AccessController.doPrivileged() to nicely play in secured environments.
- Added implementation of __defineGetter__ and __defineSetter__ to match
  SpiderMonkey. __lookupGetter__ and __lookupSetter__ are not
  implemented, nor are the JS get and set keywords.  Also see #224334.
- E4X can now be used without Apache XMLBeans, as long as DOM Level 3 is
  available.  DOM Level 3 is bundled with JDK 1.5 and can be added to JDK
  1.4.  See #355677.
